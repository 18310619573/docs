Install the SDK (includes the runtime) if you want to make apps with .NET Core. Or, install the runtime if you only need to run apps. If you're installing the runtime, we suggest you install the [ASP.NET Core runtime](#install-the-aspnet-core-runtime), as it includes both .NET Core and ASP.NET Core runtimes.

If you've already installed the SDK or runtime, use the `dotnet --list-sdks` and `dotnet --list-runtimes` commands to see which versions are installed. For more information, see [How to check that .NET Core is already installed](how-to-detect-installed-versions.md?pivots=os-linux).
